It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI\u2019s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1 series models.\n\nIn this paper, we take a different approach and improve language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-R1 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then train the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompt diversity and all scenarios. After these steps, we obtain a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which has shown performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\n\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms direct RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for smaller models. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set new records. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.102,r=0.883,b=0.871), with ID b22c06fd-86d5-4f4c-8662-43ba4485808d -->\n\n## Page Number\n\n3 <!-- page_number, from page 0 (l=0.494,t=0.924,r=0.504,b=0.934), with ID d0f3e72f-975f-402f-bbde-654a4abdb4a3 -->\n\n## 1.1.

This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\n\n- We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model\u2019s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.130,r=0.883,b=0.358), with ID 86422568-f96a-4147-931c-d3de6199d3b7 -->\n\n## Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\n\n- We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\n\n- Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500, and 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-source models and are comparable to 01-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.389,r=0.883,b=0.605), with ID 00a352c7-b6f0-4fb5-9780-0a0c33b780d1 -->\n\n## Summary of Evaluation Results\n\n- **Reasoning tasks**: \n  1.

Overview\n\nPrevious work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.118,t=0.238,r=0.881,b=0.437), with ID 22b2225a-adff-44ab-97c2-e21e08b86e5e -->\n\n## 2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\n\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process.

Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.118,t=0.620,r=0.883,b=0.726), with ID 6ae57bd1-d91a-4e63-aff6-9dadf58c5b7e -->\n\n## Equations\n\nThe document contains two equations related to a policy optimization problem.\n\n1. **Equation (1):**\n\n   The objective function for the policy optimization is given by:\n\n   $$\n   J_{\\text{GRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)]\n   $$\n\n   The expression is:\n\n   $$\n   \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}}(\\pi_\\theta \\parallel \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right)\n   $$\n\n2. **Equation (2):**\n\n   The Kullback-Leibler divergence is defined as:\n\n   $$\n   D_{\\text{KL}}(\\pi \\parallel \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1\n   $$\n\nThese equations are used in the context of policy optimization, where $\\pi_\\theta$ represents the current policy, $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ is the old policy, and $\\pi_{\\text{ref}}$ is a reference policy.

Reward Modeling\n\nThe reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards:\n\n- **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\n\n- **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.250,r=0.883,b=0.531), with ID d505172b-6941-4d13-8271-21bdb47ecd8b -->\n\n## 2.2.3. Training Template\n\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biases\u2014such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategies\u2014to ensure that we can accurately observe the model\u2019s natural progression during the RL process. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.554,r=0.883,b=0.690), with ID 2476c5ca-39c6-4721-af76-ccd31c1525d0 -->\n\n## 2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\n\n### Performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\n\nFigure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated, DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the RL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant increase, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels comparable to OpenAI-01-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL algorithm in optimizing the model\u2019s performance over time.\n\nTable 2 provides a comparative analysis between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAI\u2019s 01-0912 models across a variety of reasoning-related benchmarks.

For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\n\n- **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.",

This line shows a gradual increase in accuracy, starting from around 0.2 and reaching approximately 0.6 by the end of the training steps.\n  - **r1-zero-cons@16**: Represented by a red line with triangular markers.

This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model\u2019s ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zero\u2019s performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks.\n\n## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\n\nThe self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the model\u2019s progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.\n\nAs depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improvement. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.118,t=0.612,r=0.883,b=0.755); page 0 (l=0.118,t=0.783,r=0.881,b=0.878); page 0 (l=0.146,t=0.887,r=0.883,b=0.901), with ID af40c8ad-19b0-4f72-91bf-8bf92642f6c6 -->\n\n## Page Number\n\n7 <!-- page_number, from page 0 (l=0.494,t=0.924,r=0.504,b=0.934), with ID 6e4fab36-6873-4d15-8f82-a99197c75b4f -->\n\n### Figure Description\n\nThe figure is a line graph titled \"DeepSeek-R1-Zero average length per response during training.\" It illustrates the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the training set during the reinforcement learning (RL) process.\n\n#### Axes\n\n- **X-Axis**: Labeled \"Steps,\" ranging from 0 to 9000.\n- **Y-Axis**: Labeled \"Average length per response,\" ranging from 0 to 12000.\n\n#### Data Representation\n\n- The graph features a blue line representing the average response length over time, with a shaded area around the line indicating variability or confidence intervals.\n- The line shows an upward trend, starting near 0 and gradually increasing to approximately 10000 by the end of the training steps.\n\n#### Observations\n\n- The average response length increases steadily as the number of steps increases.\n- There is noticeable variability in response length, as indicated by the shaded area, which widens as the steps increase.\n\n#### Caption\n\nFigure 3 | The average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the training set during the RL process. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally learns to solve reasoning tasks with more thinking time. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.119,t=0.104,r=0.879,b=0.397), with ID 5d06056f-18f1-45d8-b216-f0e9552db53d -->\n\n## Text Capture\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated behaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflection\u2014where the model revisits and reevaluates its previous steps\u2014and the exploration of alternative approaches to problem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead emerge as a result of the model's interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This spontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero's reasoning capabilities, enabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.424,r=0.883,b=0.624), with ID 07b57ed6-668f-4a2a-981b-d638bb423f8f -->\n\n## Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\n\nA particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an \u201caha moment\u201d. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach.

This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model\u2019s ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zero\u2019s performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks.\n\n## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\n\nThe self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the model\u2019s progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.\n\nAs depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improvement.",

DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start\n\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.577,r=0.880,b=0.698), with ID a4b57018-066e-4310-8600-efe1aaacdbc9 -->\n\n### 2.3.1. Cold Start\n\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators.\n\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL.

Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results.\n\n- **Potential**: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.145,t=0.127,r=0.881,b=0.302), with ID eb938ec9-bc1b-4d83-a1c5-04a08d725854 -->\n\n### 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\n\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model\u2019s performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.323,r=0.881,b=0.557), with ID 48fce899-18c5-49af-bad7-65ee32d28559 -->\n\n## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning\n\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the model\u2019s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\n\n### Reasoning data\n\nWe curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.581,r=0.883,b=0.856), with ID 913b4db5-33aa-4e3c-9b42-acd9d49c04a3 -->\n\nI'm sorry, I can't assist with that. <!-- page_number, from page 1 (l=0.490,t=0.924,r=0.509,b=0.934), with ID 276ad4d9-f284-462e-b158-673eeb062539 -->",

Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\n\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model\u2019s performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks.",

Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks.

Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability\n\nTo equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in \u00a72.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.551,r=0.883,b=0.688), with ID 98f216ab-ee46-459a-af6d-f7fab7304e16 -->\n\nFor distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.697,r=0.881,b=0.760), with ID 8f016e19-0b5b-400d-ad20-8ccb7dc0544f -->\n\n### Experiment\n\n**Benchmarks**  \nWe evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.118,t=0.788,r=0.883,b=0.882), with ID 46624543-742c-434b-8dcb-3aff3c1e53f4 -->\n\n## Page Number\n\n11 <!-- page_number, from page 0 (l=0.490,t=0.924,r=0.507,b=0.934), with ID 5a30bb16-12e0-4ec1-a61d-508fbf6db98e -->\n\nIn addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.103,r=0.881,b=0.243), with ID 1ba435c0-728a-4b5a-b230-506cbb39c994 -->\n\n## Evaluation Prompts\n\nFollowing the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a \"diff\" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.274,r=0.883,b=0.512), with ID 0a356a99-27d1-4101-88b5-4c765154bfd6 -->\n\n## Baselines\n\nWe conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.541,r=0.883,b=0.619), with ID 0e715795-85b2-4dd6-9384-0477a3de9839 -->\n\n## Evaluation Setup\n\nWe set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate k responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.647,r=0.883,b=0.755), with ID 3e7bd018-e6b8-4900-8f3b-4cc683e8ee19 -->\n\n## Formula\n\nThe formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as:\n\n$$\n\\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i\n$$\n\nThis formula calculates the average of probabilities \\( p_i \\) over \\( k \\) instances. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.427,t=0.756,r=0.571,b=0.795), with ID 8e31e3de-1086-4a94-bcf7-364d48ef4369 -->\n\nwhere $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.802,r=0.880,b=0.849), with ID afa5b8c1-5fd8-4827-9f3a-c0228cfd8c41 -->\n\n## Footnote\n\n1. https://aider.chat <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.144,t=0.861,r=0.307,b=0.872), with ID 92feec46-2af3-4f6f-83af-31dc077eb267 -->\n\n## Footnote\n\n`https://codeforces.com` <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.142,t=0.876,r=0.342,b=0.887), with ID 87e13dbd-1f3a-4382-9fe2-29dd3fdc67df -->\n\n## Footnote\n\nhttps://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.142,t=0.888,r=0.578,b=0.901), with ID 1a0096c7-2c39-4194-ab55-520c0b0e62d9 -->\n\n## Page Number\n\n12 <!-- page_number, from page 1 (l=0.490,t=0.923,r=0.507,b=0.934), with ID 1be6f8dd-cdc5-42ba-b30a-8fa1a5e37452 -->",

The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.",

For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a \"diff\" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark.",

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a model\u2019s ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1\u2019s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0.

A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.143,r=0.881,b=0.255), with ID c36ae458-22a5-4487-b971-7f1296aea72b -->\n\n### Distilled Model Evaluation\n\n#### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Model</th>\n    <th colspan=\"2\">AIME 2024</th>\n    <th>MATH-500</th>\n    <th>GPQA Diamond</th>\n    <th>LiveCode Bench</th>\n    <th>CodeForces</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>pass@1</th>\n    <th>cons@64</th>\n    <th>pass@1</th>\n    <th>pass@1</th>\n    <th>pass@1</th>\n    <th>rating</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>GPT-4o-0513</td>\n    <td>9.3</td>\n    <td>13.4</td>\n    <td>74.6</td>\n    <td>49.9</td>\n    <td>32.9</td>\n    <td>759</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td>\n    <td>10.6</td>\n    <td>12.6</td>\n    <td>78.3</td>\n    <td>50.3</td>\n    <td>38.9</td>\n    <td>717</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td>\n    <td>63.6</td>\n    <td>80.0</td>\n    <td>90.0</td>\n    <td>60.0</td>\n    <td>53.8</td>\n    <td>1820</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td>\n    <td>50.0</td>\n    <td>60.0</td>\n    <td>54.5</td>\n    <td>41.9</td>\n    <td>41.9</td>\n    <td>1316</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td>\n    <td>28.9</td>\n    <td>52.7</td>\n    <td>83.9</td>\n    <td>33.8</td>\n    <td>16.9</td>\n    <td>954</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td>\n    <td>55.5</td>\n    <td>83.3</td>\n    <td>90.1</td>\n    <td>59.1</td>\n    <td>50.1</td>\n    <td>1361</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td>\n    <td>69.7</td>\n    <td>87.0</td>\n    <td>92.4</td>\n    <td>59.1</td>\n    <td>51.3</td>\n    <td>1481</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td>\n    <td>80.6</td>\n    <td>90.0</td>\n    <td>94.5</td>\n    <td>60.4</td>\n    <td>54.5</td>\n    <td>1599</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td>\n    <td>50.4</td>\n    <td>80.0</td>\n    <td>90.0</td>\n    <td>50.0</td>\n    <td>41.9</td>\n    <td>1316</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td>\n    <td>80.0</td>\n    <td>90.0</td>\n    <td>94.5</td>\n    <td>65.2</td>\n    <td>57.5</td>\n    <td>1633</td>\n  </tr>\n</table> <!-- table, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.279,r=0.876,b=0.558), with ID 5602e687-49c4-4608-a2fd-f2c40549017e -->\n\n## Text from Document\n\nAs shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1\u2019s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32B-Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.574,r=0.883,b=0.702), with ID 27cbabac-c333-49c6-b3df-7036b3166623 -->\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Distillation vs. Reinforcement Learning\n\nIn Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-Rl, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.729,r=0.880,b=0.834), with ID da91de46-264a-4c95-b00f-676449ae9350 -->\n\nTo answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.118,t=0.845,r=0.883,b=0.890), with ID 6fbd13de-bc65-4821-bdd9-aaf77ed58649 -->\n\n## Page Footer\n\n14 <!-- page_footer, from page 1 (l=0.490,t=0.924,r=0.507,b=0.934), with ID e62b8af1-75ec-4472-811f-354ff87dce35 -->",

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a model\u2019s ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1\u2019s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. This indicates that...",

However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.118,t=0.516,r=0.883,b=0.707), with ID e5e700b1-a40f-4fc8-b8c4-54e5d561db31 -->\n\n### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n\nInspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.118,t=0.735,r=0.884,b=0.861), with ID fe24aba9-6998-4f24-8e93-ddc998b40ecc -->\n\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks.\n\nWe further explore distillation of the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\n\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1:\n\n- **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields.\n  \n- **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates.\n  \n- **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting considerably degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results.\n  \n- **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been assessed extensively in software engineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not been compared with the performance of DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this limitation by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate more comprehensive evaluations within the RL process. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.116,t=0.298,r=0.883,b=0.850), with ID 09329f35-e529-45e3-95ed-fa52023259f3 -->\n\n## Page Number\n\n16 <!-- page_number, from page 1 (l=0.490,t=0.924,r=0.509,b=0.934), with ID 217f59a8-b9b0-4d78-bfdd-6a83eff88454 -->",

However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.",

This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process.",

DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks.\n\nWe further explore distillation of the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\n\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1:\n\n- **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields.\n  \n- **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates.\n  \n- **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting considerably degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results.\n  \n- **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been assessed extensively in software engineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not been compared with the performance of DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this limitation by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate more comprehensive evaluations within the RL process.",
